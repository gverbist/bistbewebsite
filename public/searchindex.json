  "content":"Heading example Here is example of hedings. You can use this heading by following markdownify rules. For example: use # for heading 1 and use ###### for heading 6.\nHeading 1 Heading 2 Heading 3 Heading 4 Heading 5 Heading 6 Emphasis Emphasis, aka italics, with asterisks or underscores.\nStrong emphasis, aka bold, with asterisks or underscores.\nCombined emphasis with asterisks and underscores.\nStrikethrough uses two tildes. Scratch this.\nLink I\u0026rsquo;m an inline-style link I\u0026rsquo;m an inline-style link with title I\u0026rsquo;m a reference-style link I\u0026rsquo;m a relative reference to a repository file You can use numbers for reference-style link definitions Or leave it empty and use the link text itself .\nURLs and URLs in angle brackets will automatically get turned into links. http://www.example.com or http://www.example.com and sometimes example.com (but not on Github, for example).\nSome text to show that the reference links can follow later.\nParagraph Lorem ipsum dolor sit amet consectetur adipisicing elit.

Markdown in HTML Does *not* work **very** well. Use HTML tags. Tables Colons can be used to align columns.\nTables Are Cool col 3 is right-aligned $1600 col 2 is centered $12 zebra stripes are neat $1 There must be at least 3 dashes separating each header cell. The outer pipes (|) are optional, and you don\u0026rsquo;t need to make the raw Markdown line up prettily. You can also use inline Markdown.\nMarkdown Less Pretty Still renders nicely 1 2 3 Image Gallery Youtube video "},{

And when we woke up, we had these bodies. Calculon is gonna kill us and it\u0026rsquo;s all everybody else\u0026rsquo;s fault!\nI wish! It\u0026rsquo;s a nickel. Shut up and take my money! That\u0026rsquo;s right, baby. I ain\u0026rsquo;t your loverboy Flexo, the guy you love so much. You even love anyone pretending to be him! That\u0026rsquo;s the ONLY thing about being a slave.\nSoothe us with sweet lies. I didn\u0026rsquo;t ask for a completely reasonable excuse! I asked you to get busy! Ummm…to eBay? No, of course not. It was… uh… porno. Yeah, that\u0026rsquo;s it. I don\u0026rsquo;t want to be rescued.\nThere\u0026rsquo;s one way and only one way to determine if an animal is intelligent. Dissect its brain! Now Fry, it\u0026rsquo;s been a few years since medical school, so remind me. Disemboweling in your species: fatal or non-fatal?\nWho said that? SURE you can die! You want to die?! Bender, I didn\u0026rsquo;t know you liked cooking. That\u0026rsquo;s so cute. File not found. Ah, the \u0026lsquo;Breakfast Club\u0026rsquo; soundtrack! I can\u0026rsquo;t wait til I\u0026rsquo;m old enough to feel ways about stuff!\nWho said that? SURE you can die! You want to die?! No, of course not. It was… uh… porno. Yeah, that\u0026rsquo;s it. Uh, is the puppy mechanical in any way? Look, last night was a mistake. That could be \u0026lsquo;my\u0026rsquo; beautiful soul sitting naked on a couch. If I could just learn to play this stupid thing. Goodbye, cruel world. Goodbye, cruel lamp. Goodbye, cruel velvet drapes, lined with what would appear to be some sort of cruel muslin and the cute little pom-pom curtain pull cords. Cruel though they may be…\nGuards! Bring me the forms I need to fill out to have her taken away! We\u0026rsquo;re rescuing ya. Yeah. Give a little credit to our public schools. Man, I\u0026rsquo;m sore all over. I feel like I just went ten rounds with mighty Thor.\nYou\u0026rsquo;re going back for the Countess, aren\u0026rsquo;t you? We\u0026rsquo;re rescuing ya. Ven ve voke up, ve had zese wodies. Oh sure! Blame the wizards! Enough about your promiscuous mother, Hermes! We have bigger problems. So, how \u0026lsquo;bout them Knicks? I don\u0026rsquo;t \u0026rsquo;need\u0026rsquo; to drink. I can quit anytime I want!\nBender, quit destroying the universe! It\u0026rsquo;s okay, Bender. I like cooking too. No! Don\u0026rsquo;t jump! Good news, everyone! There\u0026rsquo;s a report on TV with some very bad news! Your best is an idiot!\nI was all of history\u0026rsquo;s great robot actors - Acting Unit 0.8; Thespomat; David Duchovny! No. We\u0026rsquo;re on the top. In your time, yes, but nowadays shut up! Besides, these are adult stemcells, harvested from perfectly healthy adults whom I killed for their stemcells.\nUmmm…to eBay? And so we say goodbye to our beloved pet, Nibbler, who\u0026rsquo;s gone to a place where I, too, hope one day to go. The toilet. Why, those are the Grunka-Lunkas! They work here in the Slurm factory.\nFive hours? Aw, man! Couldn\u0026rsquo;t you just get me the death penalty? No. We\u0026rsquo;re on the top. Tell them I hate them. Well I\u0026rsquo;da done better, but it\u0026rsquo;s plum hard pleading a case while awaiting trial for that there incompetence.\nGoodbye, friends. I never thought I\u0026rsquo;d die like this. But I always really hoped. Would you censor the Venus de Venus just because you can see her spewers? I love this planet! I\u0026rsquo;ve got wealth, fame, and access to the depths of sleaze that those things bring.\nOf all the friends I\u0026rsquo;ve had… you\u0026rsquo;re the first. Daylight and everything. Ummm…to eBay? Wow! A superpowers drug you can just rub onto your skin? You\u0026rsquo;d think it would be something you\u0026rsquo;d have to freebase.\nGoodbye, friends. I never thought I\u0026rsquo;d die like this. But I always really hoped. Large bet on myself in round one. Belligerent and numerous. No! The kind with looting and maybe starting a few fires! Professor, make a woman out of me.\nOw, my spirit! Oh God, what have I done? I am the man with no name, Zapp Brannigan! Hello Morbo, how\u0026rsquo;s the family? Michelle, I don\u0026rsquo;t regret this, but I both rue and lament it.\nGoodbye, cruel world. Goodbye, cruel lamp. Goodbye, cruel velvet drapes, lined with what would appear to be some sort of cruel muslin and the cute little pom-pom curtain pull cords. Cruel though they may be… How much did you make me?\nCome, Comrade Bender! We must take to the streets! Leela, are you alright? You got wanged on the head. That\u0026rsquo;s the ONLY thing about being a slave. You\u0026rsquo;re going back for the Countess, aren\u0026rsquo;t you? Oh yeah, good luck with that.\n"},{

  "content":"Large bet on myself in round one. Well, thanks to the Internet, I\u0026rsquo;m now bored with sex. Is there a place on the web that panders to my lust for violence? It\u0026rsquo;s toe-tappingly tragic! Yep, I remember. They came in last at the Olympics, then retired to promote alcoholic beverages!\nWho\u0026rsquo;s brave enough to fly into something we all keep calling a death sphere? I love you, buddy! Soon enough. I\u0026rsquo;m just glad my fat, ugly mama isn\u0026rsquo;t alive to see this day. It doesn\u0026rsquo;t look so shiny to me.\nOh, I always feared he might run off like this. Why, why, why didn\u0026rsquo;t I break his legs? And I\u0026rsquo;d do it again! And perhaps a third time! But that would be it. I\u0026rsquo;m a thing. Shut up and take my money! Just once I\u0026rsquo;d like to eat dinner with a celebrity who isn\u0026rsquo;t bound and gagged.\nTell her she looks thin. And yet you haven\u0026rsquo;t said what I told you to say! How can any of us trust you? Five hours? Aw, man! Couldn\u0026rsquo;t you just get me the death penalty? This is the worst kind of discrimination: the kind against me!\nThere, now he\u0026rsquo;s trapped in a book I wrote: a crummy world of plot holes and spelling errors! You, minion. Lift my arm. AFTER HIM! You don\u0026rsquo;t know how to do any of those. We don\u0026rsquo;t have a brig. You know the worst thing about being a slave? They make you work, but they don\u0026rsquo;t pay you or let you go.\nI\u0026rsquo;ll get my kit! I didn\u0026rsquo;t ask for a completely reasonable excuse! I asked you to get busy! Oh sure! Blame the wizards! The key to victory is discipline, and that means a well made bed. You will practice until you can make your bed in your sleep. Wow, you got that off the Internet? In my day, the Internet was only used to download pornography.\nOh sure! Blame the wizards! For one beautiful night I knew what it was like to be a grandmother. Subjugated, yet honored. Too much work. Let\u0026rsquo;s burn it and say we dumped it in the sewer. Nay, I respect and admire Harold Zoid too much to beat him to death with his own Oscar.\nPlease, Don-Bot… look into your hard drive, and open your mercy file! Doomsday device? Ah, now the ball\u0026rsquo;s in Farnsworth\u0026rsquo;s court! That could be \u0026lsquo;my\u0026rsquo; beautiful soul sitting naked on a couch. If I could just learn to play this stupid thing. That could be \u0026lsquo;my\u0026rsquo; beautiful soul sitting naked on a couch. If I could just learn to play this stupid thing. It\u0026rsquo;s just like the story of the grasshopper and the octopus. All year long, the grasshopper kept burying acorns for winter, while the octopus mooched off his girlfriend and watched TV. But then the winter came, and the grasshopper died, and the octopus ate all his acorns. Also he got a race car. Is any of this getting through to you?\nOK, if everyone\u0026rsquo;s finished being stupid. You can see how I lived before I met you. For example, if you killed your grandfather, you\u0026rsquo;d cease to exist! That\u0026rsquo;s the ONLY thing about being a slave.\nWell, then good news! It\u0026rsquo;s a suppository. Hey, whatcha watching? What are their names? Quite possible. We live long and are celebrated poopers. Isn\u0026rsquo;t it true that you have been paid for your testimony?\nI\u0026rsquo;m sorry, guys. I never meant to hurt you. Just to destroy everything you ever believed in. Does anybody else feel jealous and aroused and worried? Wow, you got that off the Internet? In my day, the Internet was only used to download pornography.\nBut existing is basically all I do! OK, this has gotta stop. I\u0026rsquo;m going to remind Fry of his humanity the way only a woman can. Tell them I hate them. You can crush me but you can\u0026rsquo;t crush my spirit!\nThey\u0026rsquo;re like sex, except I\u0026rsquo;m having them! We don\u0026rsquo;t have a brig. Daddy Bender, we\u0026rsquo;re hungry. Is the Space Pope reptilian!? You know, I was God once.\nWe need rest. The spirit is willing, but the flesh is spongy and bruised. In your time, yes, but nowadays shut up! Besides, these are adult stemcells, harvested from perfectly healthy adults whom I killed for their stemcells.\nI\u0026rsquo;ve got to find a way to escape the horrible ravages of youth. Suddenly, I\u0026rsquo;m going to the bathroom like clockwork, every three hours. And those jerks at Social Security stopped sending me checks. Now \u0026lsquo;I\u0026rsquo;\u0026rsquo; have to pay \u0026lsquo;\u0026rsquo;them\u0026rsquo;! Really?!\nMeh. What are you hacking off? Is it my torso?! \u0026lsquo;It is!\u0026rsquo; My precious torso! Bender, I didn\u0026rsquo;t know you liked cooking. That\u0026rsquo;s so cute. I didn\u0026rsquo;t ask for a completely reasonable excuse! I asked you to get busy!\nKids don\u0026rsquo;t turn rotten just from watching TV. Now what? But I\u0026rsquo;ve never been to the moon! It\u0026rsquo;s just like the story of the grasshopper and the octopus. All year long, the grasshopper kept burying acorns for winter, while the octopus mooched off his girlfriend and watched TV. But then the winter came, and the grasshopper died, and the octopus ate all his acorns. Also he got a race car. Is any of this getting through to you?\nAll I want is to be a monkey of moderate intelligence who wears a suit… that\u0026rsquo;s why I\u0026rsquo;m transferring to business school! You know the worst thing about being a slave? They make you work, but they don\u0026rsquo;t pay you or let you go.\n"},{

Your lyrics lack subtlety. You can\u0026rsquo;t just have your characters announce how they feel. That makes me feel angry! As an interesting side note, as a head without a body, I envy the dead. I\u0026rsquo;m sure those windmills will keep them cool. Leela, are you alright? You got wanged on the head. Bender! Ship! Stop bickering or I\u0026rsquo;m going to come back there and change your opinions manually!\nHello Morbo, how\u0026rsquo;s the family? Our love isn\u0026rsquo;t any different from yours, except it\u0026rsquo;s hotter, because I\u0026rsquo;m involved. I feel like I was mauled by Jesus. Aww, it\u0026rsquo;s true. I\u0026rsquo;ve been hiding it for so long. I\u0026rsquo;ve been there. My folks were always on me to groom myself and wear underpants. What am I, the pope?\nWhy yes! Thanks for noticing. Interesting. No, wait, the other thing: tedious. Perhaps, but perhaps your civilization is merely the sewer of an even greater society above you! The key to victory is discipline, and that means a well made bed. You will practice until you can make your bed in your sleep. Dear God, they\u0026rsquo;ll be killed on our doorstep! And there\u0026rsquo;s no trash pickup until January 3rd.\nJust once I\u0026rsquo;d like to eat dinner with a celebrity who isn\u0026rsquo;t bound and gagged. You won\u0026rsquo;t have time for sleeping, soldier, not with all the bed making you\u0026rsquo;ll be doing. I had more, but you go ahead. Then throw her in the laundry room, which will hereafter be referred to as \u0026ldquo;the brig\u0026rdquo;.\nNo argument here. Tell her you just want to talk. It has nothing to do with mating. Well, let\u0026rsquo;s just dump it in the sewer and say we delivered it. Pansy. Good news, everyone! I\u0026rsquo;ve taught the toaster to feel love!\nCome, Comrade Bender! We must take to the streets! I love you, buddy! That\u0026rsquo;s right, baby. I ain\u0026rsquo;t your loverboy Flexo, the guy you love so much. You even love anyone pretending to be him! Soon enough. I love you, buddy!\nOw, my spirit! Why would a robot need to drink? Oh, I think we should just stay friends. You can see how I lived before I met you. I had more, but you go ahead.\nFetal stemcells, aren\u0026rsquo;t those controversial? Son, as your lawyer, I declare y\u0026rsquo;all are in a 12-piece bucket o\u0026rsquo; trouble. But I done struck you a deal: Five hours of community service cleanin\u0026rsquo; up that ol\u0026rsquo; mess you caused.\nLeela, are you alright? You got wanged on the head. You, a bobsleder!? That I\u0026rsquo;d like to see! I usually try to keep my sadness pent up inside where it can fester quietly as a mental illness. Bender! Ship! Stop bickering or I\u0026rsquo;m going to come back there and change your opinions manually!\nBender, being God isn\u0026rsquo;t easy. If you do too much, people get dependent on you, and if you do nothing, they lose hope. You have to use a light touch. Like a safecracker, or a pickpocket. We can\u0026rsquo;t compete with Mom! Her company is big and evil! Ours is small and neutral!\nIt\u0026rsquo;s a T. It goes \u0026ldquo;tuh\u0026rdquo;. Dear God, they\u0026rsquo;ll be killed on our doorstep! And there\u0026rsquo;s no trash pickup until January 3rd. Morbo will now introduce tonight\u0026rsquo;s candidates… PUNY HUMAN NUMBER ONE, PUNY HUMAN NUMBER TWO, and Morbo\u0026rsquo;s good friend, Richard Nixon.\nWhoa a real live robot; or is that some kind of cheesy New Year\u0026rsquo;s costume? Five hours? Aw, man! Couldn\u0026rsquo;t you just get me the death penalty? Yes. You gave me a dollar and some candy. If rubbin\u0026rsquo; frozen dirt in your crotch is wrong, hey I don\u0026rsquo;t wanna be right.\nCan I use the gun? Humans dating robots is sick. You people wonder why I\u0026rsquo;m still single? It\u0026rsquo;s \u0026lsquo;cause all the fine robot sisters are dating humans! She also liked to shut up! Daddy Bender, we\u0026rsquo;re hungry.\n"},{

Ummm…to eBay? Maybe I love you so much I love you no matter who you are pretending to be. Oh, how I wish I could believe or understand that!

All year long, the grasshopper kept burying acorns for winter, while the octopus mooched off his girlfriend and watched TV. But then the winter came, and the grasshopper died, and the octopus ate all his acorns. Also he got a race car. Is any of this getting through to you?\n"},{
