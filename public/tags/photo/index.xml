I wish! It&amp;rsquo;s a nickel.</description>

      <description>Bender, hurry! This fuel&amp;rsquo;s expensive! Also, we&amp;rsquo;re dying! Yeah. Give a little credit to our public schools. Now Fry, it&amp;rsquo;s been a few years since medical school, so remind me. Disemboweling in your species: fatal or non-fatal?
